  Hello world! My name is Jacinda and I love to program! I am from Rockville, Maryland, and have one lovely younger sister. I currently work at a small arts nonprofit as the Development and Communications Associate, doing a range of nonprofit-y things from printing and stuffing 1500 envelopes with donation cards, writing copy, pulling a list, and coding an email, to configuring our CRM system to pull a report of all new donors in the past fiscal year.</p>


<p> I currently live in Cambridge, where bums and MIT/Harvard grad students alike walk the streets of Mass Ave. I love living in Boston where there is so much variety in things to do, people of all backgrounds, restaurants, and where it's small enough that I randomly bump into friends on a regular basis. (whether I want to or not)</p>

<p> I really love dark chocolate. I have to eat some every day, and I eat ice cream almost every day. It's an addiction! Sugar is one of my BFFs. During my baking phase, I had so much fun baking delicious things with chocolate, sugar, and butter. My favorite (but very time consuming) pastry was vegan cinnamon rolls. Banana chocolate chip muffins came in second!</p>

<p> I used to be watch So You Think You Can Dance religiously, and was hooked because I loved the high level dancers that came to audition for the show. It continues to baffle my mind how many talented people there are out there for these reality TV shows. And yet only a few make it on the show! Some of my new favorite TV shows include Game of Thrones, New Girl, and Downton Abbey.

<p> Thanks for stopping by! PS. my favorite color is purple.</p>

<h2> Why Code?</h2>

<img class="img-rounded img-polaroid image-right" src="/images/program-all-things.jpeg" border="0" width="300" class="imgCaptionRight">

<p> It all started with an HTML/CSS/Javascript class that I took to fulfill a distribution requirement in college. At the time I was thinking, "jeez, those distribution requirements are so annoying! and useless!". Then I got a few internships that all decided to use my very little HTML skills, and then my jobs decided I should be the webmaster since I had HTML experience. One built on top of the other, and next thing I knew I was 2 years out of college, and enjoyed coding HTML the most out of all of my job responsibilities. Time seemed to fly by when I was coding.</p>

<p> Then I decided to take a free class to learn more about programming. edX was offering their 6.00.1.x Introduction to Computer Science using Python class, and I eagerly signed up. Little did I know that this would result in 15-20 hours of week per week, and many long nights of frustration mixed with "OMG OMG it worked!!" Friends were no longer a part of my life, and when I did have extra free time (thank goodness some code worked), I wanted to sleep and start fresh on the next set of lectures. Again, time seemed to fly by and I found myself coding for 8-10 hours on the weekends, without blinking an eye. (but with lots of coffee).</p>

<p> I never thought of myself as a math person, but computer science and programming is so much fun! I realized that I wanted to become a developer when time flew by so quickly, and everytime I got something to work, all the frustration was 100&#37; worth it! Ironically it might even be the fact that I do not see myself as a "math/science" person makes me feel even more gratification when I am able to solve problems and code things from scratch.</p>


<h2>  Why Launch Academy?</h2>

<p> After attending PyLadies meetups and talking to friends, I heard about RailsBridge. At RailsBridge, I heard about bootcamps, and spoke with a few of the recent graduates. Everyone seemed to have loved their experience, felt like they learned so much, and on top of that, they all seemed to be really good friends with each other! They weren't just coding for 16 hours alone, but we were working together to learn Ruby, and having loads of fun doing it. I immediately wanted to sign up. And by immediately, I mean that I wanted to quit my job the next day and start learning! The idea of being able to dedicate all of my time to learning to code and working on fun side projects was so appealing to me. Combined with skills instructors to teach us using a curriculum and the ability to work with other students eager to get coding, I knew I wanted to apply.</p>

<p> After speaking with a few Launch Academy recent graduates, Launch Academy is definitely the right fit for me. I like that there is a structured curriculum, that there are instructors and TAs dedicated to helping you learn and succeed, and I like that there are organized group projects. The more intense, the better! I look forward to spending many long hours coding and also having the time of my life. I know I will be coding with others who are just as motivated as me, and gain experience with pair programming and TDD &mdash; both of which would be extremely difficult to do on my own.</p>



<h2> What am I working on now?</h2>

<h2>For Funsies</h2>

My favorite couple, Michael and Joanna.They won Blackpool (Olympics for ballroom) 8 years in a row! I saw them at the MIT Open Ballroom Competition in April 2014, and it was a dream. They're amazing.</p>

<p>Once upon a time in college land, I was obsessed with collegiate competitive ballroom dance and spent all my free time taking the Wellesley College bus to MIT to dance class. I wore extremely sparkly costumes, put way too much gel in my hair (the idea is that your hair should be/feel like a rock, it should not move. ever.) Then I switched to salsa/bachata dancing and joined a performance team with the Salsa Matei Dance Company. I had loads of fun dancing with only-occassionally sketchy dudes, and discovered that the dudes who actually could dance were not the ones asking you to dance because you wore a really short and skin-tight dress.</p>


<p> Then I gave up dancing and instead picked up long-distance running. I am so proud to say that I started running for the first time in my life in April 2013 and then ran the B.A.A. half marathon in October! I never dreamed I could finish it, let alone not be the last one to finish. I continue to run outside when my toes don't feel frost-biten by the temperature outside. Otherwise, I have enjoyed taking spin classes a few times a week at the gym, as well as occassionally doing some yoga.</p>
