p It all started with an HTML/CSS/Javascript class that I took to fulfill a distribution requirement in college. At the time I was thinking, "jeez, those distribution requirements are so annoying! and useless!". Then I got a few internships that all decided to use my very little HTML skills, and then my jobs decided I should be the webmaster since I had HTML experience. One built on top of the other, and next thing I knew I was 2 years out of college, and enjoyed coding HTML the most out of all of my job responsibilities. Time seemed to fly by when I was coding.

p Then I decided to take a free class to learn more about programming. edX was offering their 6.00.1.x Introduction to Computer Science using Python class, and I eagerly signed up. Little did I know that this would result in 15-20 hours of week per week, and many long nights of frustration mixed with "OMG OMG it worked!!" Friends were no longer a part of my life, and when I did have extra free time (thank goodness some code worked), I wanted to sleep and start fresh on the next set of lectures. Again, time seemed to fly by and I found myself coding for 8-10 hours on the weekends, without blinking an eye. (but with lots of coffee).

p I never thought of myself as a math person, but computer science and programming is so much fun! I realized that I wanted to become a developer when time flew by so quickly, and everytime I got something to work, all the frustration was 100&#37; worth it! Ironically it might even be the fact that I do not see myself as a "math/science" person makes me feel even more gratification when I am able to solve problems and code things from scratch.


h2 Why Launch Academy?

p After attending PyLadies meetups and talking to friends, I heard about RailsBridge. At RailsBridge, I heard about bootcamps, and spoke with a few of the recent graduates. Everyone seemed to have loved their experience, felt like they learned so much, and on top of that, they all seemed to be really good friends with each other! They weren't just coding for 16 hours alone, but we were working together to learn Ruby, and having loads of fun doing it. I immediately wanted to sign up. And by immediately, I mean that I wanted to quit my job the next day and start learning! The idea of being able to dedicate all of my time to learning to code and working on fun side projects was so appealing to me. Combined with skills instructors to teach us using a curriculum and the ability to work with other students eager to get coding, I knew I wanted to apply.

p After speaking with a few Launch Academy recent graduates, Launch Academy is definitely the right fit for me. I like that there is a structured curriculum, that there are instructors and TAs dedicated to helping you learn and succeed, and I like that there are organized group projects. The more intense, the better! I look forward to spending many long hours coding and also having the time of my life. I know I will be coding with others who are just as motivated as me, and gain experience with pair programming and TDD &mdash; both of which would be extremely difficult to do on my own.

p I can't wait to start at Launch Academy!


h2 What am I working on now?

p Currently I am working on all of my Launch Academy prework! Whew! That includes watching videos and doing exercises on Treehouse about SQL, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Responsive Web Design, and more. I am also working on problems from <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>, and going through the "Jump Start Sinatra" book to learn to use the Sinatra framework! I'm learning to use SLIM, which has been very interesting.

p I am hoping to use Sinatra to build my personal website and a web application for ticket scanning. While learning to program at home, I was working an amazing arts nonprofit called Cantata Singers, which is a Boston choir and orchestra. We used the CRM called PatronManager, which enabled Cantata Singers to capture all ticketing, giving, and email information per patron. It kind of functioned like Facebook where you have "profiles" of individual people, and then their ticketing/giving/email information was listed under that contact. Cantata Singers currently can't afford the technology to take advantage of PatronManager's Android-only phone application for ticket scanning, and I'm hoping that a lightweight framework like Sinatra will be a great solution for this. Cantata Singers staff can still use their phones, or use a laptop to access the application. They would be able to either scan tickets (using a phone), or enter some kind of numerical identifier (TBD what this number is going to be!), to mark off in someone's contact that they actually attended the concert.
